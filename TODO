- create TxInputWitness class that includes the witness script and knows how to serialize itself
- create get_wtxid method!
- segwit txs are valid but they are not identical to those that bitcoin core creates; there seems to be a difference in the signature calculation..?
- tx serialization with no signed inputs produces a serialization which includes the 0001 segwit marker and thus is not identical to bitcoin core (the signed transaction is fine though) -- need a better way to check for segwit
- should we use copy.deepcopy instead of the tx-related copy methods?
- serialization of witnesses supports only script of size 252 and lower; that is because a simple len() is used instead of a compactSize/VarInt which allows up to 8 bytes of integers!
- explain get_transaction_segwit_digest() better and test further
- test some more segwit txs including nested ones
- bech32 address for testnet and regtest are intentionally different -- update it!
- add explicit documentation for each module before members...
- node proxy should accept full url as well
- make all code < 80 chars !?

- commit docs/usage/proxy.rst
- clean and comment the segwit examples !
- segwit in documentation !?
